# LinkedIn---Job-Posts-Insights-Dataset
In this repository I will be doing Exploratory Data Analysis (i.e., EDA) to elaborate more information about the given dataset in a very elaborate way without any errors to enhance the capacity and capability of our predictions to make sure that we are having a better prediction performance on the given pipeline.



Next, let's proceed with exploring each potential target variable to determine which one is most suitable for our predictive modeling task. We'll visualize the distribution of each variable and examine its relationship with other features in the dataset.

Here's how we can continue:

Explore Hiring Outcome:
Visualize the distribution of hiring outcomes (e.g., successful hires) and examine how it varies across different categories of other features.

Explore Salary:
Visualize the distribution of salaries and investigate factors that may influence salary levels, such as job title, industry, and location.

Explore Employment Type:
Analyze the distribution of employment types (e.g., full-time, part-time, contract) and explore how they relate to other features in the dataset.

Explore Industry:
Visualize the distribution of job postings across different industries and examine how industry impacts hiring outcomes and other variables.

Based on these explorations, we can choose the most appropriate target variable for our predictive model.

Let me know if you'd like to prioritize exploring a specific target variable, or if you have any other preferences for the analysis!
